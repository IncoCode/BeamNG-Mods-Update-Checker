The program checks changes of title of a thread and changes in attachments in the first message of a thread. If changes are noticed - the program shows the notification (and highlights the updated threads in a green color).

You need to specify links to threads, whose updates you want to track (Threads => Add threads). Updates are checked every 120 minutes (interval can be changed in the options).
